# ECG-classification

## KD classification
For practical deployment, we use the SVM method. The best SVM model can be learned by
`SVM-model-clf-best.ipynb`

The other machine learning method can be found in `disease_clf.ipynb` and it will save the ROC metric into a file and use `metric.ipynb` to visualize the saved metrics.
